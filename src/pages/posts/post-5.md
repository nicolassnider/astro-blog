Now I have a fifth blog post! today i have installed @astrojs/rss and created an .xlm feed document.
After that I have builded the application with:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then i have deployed the application to netlify. 
now you can check the rss feed in any rss reader using this url https://profound-sundae-5495e8.netlify.app/rss.xml.
